# Trash: Unix Utility
 - trash is a command that removes files temporarily and deletes them after *30?* days
 - the challenge is to only use bash

## To Do
 - check file/folder, only implement files currently
 - argument parsing (command line options)
 - add removed files to list
 - length of time customization
 - systemd process
